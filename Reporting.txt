(Key Insights)

- Hottest Day : July 22, 2007 (39.91°C) 
- Coldest Day : February 10, 2012 (-21.82°C)

- Correlation between Temperature and Humidity :
  A moderate negative correlation exists, meaning as temperature increases, humidity tends to decrease.

- Do Rainy Days Tend to Have Lower Temperatures?
  No – rainy days are warmer on average than non-rainy days :
  Rainy : 13.85°C
  Non-rainy : -3.27°C

- Wind Speed by Weather Type :
  Rain : 10.97 km/h
  Snow : 9.48 km/h
  Rainy days are associated with slightly stronger winds.
