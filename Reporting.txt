1) Data Loading and Cleaning

We started by loading the dataset and making sure the dates were correctly parsed. The Date column was set as the index for easier time-based analysis.
 Any missing values in the precipitation type were removed to keep the data clean.



2) Basic Statistics

We calculated basic statistics such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum for temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure, wind bearing, and visibility.
 We also looked at how often different precipitation types and weather summaries appear in the data.



3) Univariate Analysis

We visualized the distribution of temperature, humidity, and wind speed using histograms.
Bar charts helped us understand how frequently different precipitation types and weather conditions occur.



4) Time Series Trends

We examined daily, monthly, and yearly averages for temperature, pressure, wind bearing, visibility, humidity, and wind speed.
These time series plots revealed clear seasonal trends and long-term changes in the weather variables.



5) Bivariate Analysis and Correlations

The correlation between temperature and humidity was calculated, showing a correlation coefficient of approximately corr / temp / hum.
 This suggests that temperature and humidity are [negatively/positively] related.
On rainy days, the average temperature was about rainy avg degrees Celsius, which is lower than the average temperature of dry avg degrees Celsius on dry days. 
This indicates that rainy days tend to be cooler.
Wind speed and visibility varied depending on the type of precipitation, reflecting different weather conditions.



6) Key Insights

The hottest day in the dataset was on hottest date with a temperature of hottest temp degrees Celsius.
The coldest day was on coldest date with a temperature of coldest temp degrees Celsius.
Temperature and humidity showed a correlation coefficient of corr / temp / hum.
Rainy days are generally cooler than dry days.
Wind speed and visibility differ based on precipitation type, showing how weather conditions affect these variables.
